            <h3 class="heading-medium">What is in the Register?</h3>

            <p>The register lists the organisations that are approved to deliver apprenticeship training.</p>

            <h3 class="heading-small">UKPRN</h3>
            <p>This is the organisation's UK Provider Reference Number (UKPRN). More information about the UKPRN can be found at <a href="https://www.ukrlp.co.uk" target="_blank">https://www.ukrlp.co.uk</a>.</p>

            <h3 class="heading-small">Organisation Name</h3>
            <p>This is the legal name from UK Register of Learning Providers (UKRLP). For sole traders and partnerships, we list the name on UKRLP and trading name. Organisation names displayed in digital accounts will also be sourced from UKRLP.</p>

            <h3 class="heading-small">Provider Type</h3>
            <p>The 3 provider types are:</p>

            <ul class="list list-bullet">
                <li>Main provider - can be selected by levied employers to deliver apprenticeship training, or selected by another main provider to work as a subcontractor</li>
                <li>Employer provider – levy paying employers who provide training to their own staff or to apprentices of their connected companies</li>
                <li>Supporting provider - organisations that only deliver as a subcontractor up to a value of £500,000 per year in total</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="heading-small">Parent Company Guarantee</h3>
            <p>If this field is set to 'TRUE', then the financial health assessment for this organisation was moderated to a pass due to the submission of a parent company guarantee with their application to the RoATP.</p>

            <h3 class="heading-small">New Organisation Without Financial Track Record</h3>
            <p>If this field is set to 'TRUE', then the organisation has not been trading for a sufficient period to provide a fully complete set of financial statements as part of the RoATP application process. A financial health judgement was based on management accounts and forecasts (where applicable).</p>
